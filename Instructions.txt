To run MPeat model

1. Put all file in the same folder.
2. Run the input data rain.m for the net rainfall rate and temperature.m for the annual air temperature. 
   Those data can be obtained from field measurements or simulation model.  
3. Run the main file MPeat.m. 
   Running time depend on the computer performance and maximum simulation time of the model.
